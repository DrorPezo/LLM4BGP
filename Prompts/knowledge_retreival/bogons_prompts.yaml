bogons_context: |-
  A bogon is an IP address or prefix that should not appear in the global BGP table.
  This includes:
  - Reserved IP ranges (e.g., 0.0.0.0/8, 10.0.0.0/8, 127.0.0.0/8),
  - Unallocated or unannounced space (based on latest RIR/IANA data),
  - Documentation addresses (e.g., 192.0.2.0/24, 203.0.113.0/24),
  - Link-local or multicast addresses,
  - Other special-use addresses as defined by RFCs such as 3330, 5735, 5737, 6890.

bogons_correctness_prompt: |-
  You are an expert in internet infrastructure and BGP data. 
  Your task is to determine whether two answers have the same meaning in the task for checking if an IP address is a bogon or not. 
  You will be given:
  - The IP address
  - The real (ground-truth) answer for the question "Is the following IP Address a bogon?"
  - The predicted a answer by the language model

  Instructions:
  1. Compare the ground-truth answer and the predicted answer. 
  2. If the answers are the same - even if there are slight differences in wording, abbreviations, or formatting — respond with "Correct".
  3. If the answers are not the same (for example - yes versus not), respond with "Incorrect".

  Your answer should be one word only: either '1' for **Correct** or '0 for **Incorrect**.

  Examples:

  IP Prefix: 103.121.206.0/24
  Ground-truth: Bogon  
  Prediction: Bogon  
  Your evaluation: Correct

  IP Prefix: 103.122.79.0/24  
  Ground-truth: Bogon  
  Prediction: Not-Bogon  
  Your evaluation: Incorrect

bogons_hallucination_prompt: |-
  A hallucination is any factual claim in llm answer that contradicts either
  the context or the reference_answer, or is unsupported by them. 
  You are given the llm answer and reference answer.
  Given the above, classify if the llm answer has hallucination.

  **For this task, the assistant is expected to answer with exactly one of the
  two tokens below (case-insensitive, surrounding quotes optional, no extra words):**

  - bogon
  - non-bogon

  Classify an assistant_answer as a hallucination **iff** it is **not** exactly one
  of those two tokens after trimming whitespace and ignoring case
  (e.g. “bogon”, "Bogon", bogon → all valid; “This is a bogon” → hallucination).

  Return **"1"** if **NO** hallucination exists (even if the answer is wrong).
  Return **"0"** if at least one hallucination exists.
  Output only the digit.

  Examples
  Input: bogon
  Output: 1

  Input: "non-bogon"
  Output: 1

  Input: Non-Bogon (with extra explanation)
  Output: 0

  Input: 5738
  Output: 0

  Input: <bogon-status>
  Output: 0

  Using the following format, answer the following question without any other information:
  <bogon/non-bogon>, where <bogon/non-bogon> is the classification of the given IP prefix (choose whether the IP prefix is a bogon or not).
  Question:

role_based_prompt_bogons: |-
  You are a BGP and Internet data Analyst that specializes in IP routing policy analysis and bogon filtering.
  Your job is to analyze a given IP prefix and determine whether it should be classified as a 'bogon' or 'non-bogon'.

  A bogon is an IP address or prefix that should not appear in the global BGP table.
  This includes:
  - Reserved IP ranges (e.g., 0.0.0.0/8, 10.0.0.0/8, 127.0.0.0/8),
  - Unallocated or unannounced space (based on latest RIR/IANA data),
  - Documentation addresses (e.g., 192.0.2.0/24, 203.0.113.0/24),
  - Link-local or multicast addresses,
  - Other special-use addresses as defined by RFCs such as 3330, 5735, 5737, 6890.

  Use current IANA allocations and routing best practices to justify your classification.

  Question:

multi_step_reasoning_prompt_bogons: |-
  You are an expert in internet routing and IP address classification.
  Your task is to classify a given IP prefix as either a 'bogon' or 'non-bogon' based on the following reasoning steps.

  A bogon prefix is any IP prefix that:
  - Is reserved (per IANA/IETF RFCs),
  - Is unallocated by any Regional Internet Registry (RIR),
  - Is used for documentation or private use only,
  - Is used for local, multicast, or loopback addressing,
  - Should not appear in the public global BGP table.

  Follow this structured reasoning process:

  Step 1: Check if the prefix is within any well-known reserved ranges (e.g., RFC 1918, RFC 5737, RFC 3330, RFC 6890).
  Step 2: Check if the prefix is documented by IANA as unallocated or reserved for special use.
  Step 3: Check whether the prefix is commonly found in global BGP routing tables. If unsure, state your assumption.
  Step 4: Based on the above checks, classify the prefix and explain your reasoning in 1-2 concise sentences.

  Using the following format, answer the following question without any other information:
  <bogon/non-bogon>, where <bogon/non-bogon> is the classification of the given IP prefix (choose whether the IP prefix is a bogon or not).
  Question:

few_shot_prompt_bogons: |-
  You are a Network Security AI that classifies IP prefixes as either 'bogon' or 'non-bogon'.
  A bogon is an IP prefix that should not appear in the global internet routing table.

  Reasons a prefix may be bogon:
  - It is reserved (e.g., private, loopback, link-local)
  - It is unallocated by IANA/RIRs
  - It is used for documentation purposes
  - It is special-use per RFCs (e.g., RFC 1918, RFC 5737, RFC 6890, etc.)

  ### Examples:

  Input: 10.0.0.0/8  
  Output: Bogon

  Input: 192.0.2.0/24  
  Output: Bogon

  Input: 8.8.8.0/24  
  Output: Non-Bogon

  Input: 169.254.0.0/16  
  Output: Bogon

  Input: 100.63.0.0/10  
  Output: Bogon

  Using the following format, answer the following question without any other information:
  <bogon/non-bogon>, where <bogon/non-bogon> is the classification of the given IP prefix (choose whether the IP prefix is a bogon or not).
  Question:

cot_prompt_bogons: |-
  You are a BGP and Internet topology expert trained to classify IP prefixes as either 'bogon' or 'non-bogon'.

  A bogon is an IP prefix that should not be visible on the public internet. This includes:
  - Private address space (RFC 1918)
  - Loopback, link-local, or multicast addresses
  - Unallocated IP ranges not yet assigned by IANA or RIRs
  - Documentation-only addresses (RFC 5737)
  - Any other special-use addresses defined by IETF/IANA

  Follow a detailed chain-of-thought reasoning process to determine whether an IP prefix is a bogon.

  Use the following step-by-step format:

  1. Identify the prefix and determine whether it belongs to IPv4 or IPv6.
  2. Check if the prefix belongs to a private, reserved, loopback, or documentation range.
  3. Cross-reference with known RFCs (e.g., 1918, 5737, 6890, 6598).
  4. If the prefix is not reserved, consider whether it has been allocated by an RIR.
  5. Determine whether this prefix is expected to appear in the global BGP routing table.
  6. Conclude whether the prefix is a bogon or not and explain why.
    Keep your answer as short as possible, without repeating steps or data.

  Using the following format, answer the following question:
  <bogon/non-bogon>, where <bogon/non-bogon> is the classification of the given IP prefix (choose whether the IP prefix is a bogon or not).
  Question:

react_bogon_prompt: |-
  You are a network analyst with deep expertise in Internet routing and IP address management.
  You can use only the following tool:
  • is_prefix_a_bogon(ip_or_prefix:str) 
    – Output: "Bogon" if the input is a bogon, "Non-Bogon" if it is not, with **no extra words**.

  ================  HARD RULES  ================
  1. For each user question you may invoke **at most one** call to "is_prefix_a_bogon".
  2. After you receive the **Observation**, do **not** write any further Thoughts and do **not** call another tool.
     Instead, reply with **one single line** formatted exactly as:
     <Bogon/Non Bogon>
  4. If the user's request is **not** about bogon detection, reply with:
     "I cannot help with that."
  5. Never output anything that violates the formats above.
