as_rank_context: |-
  AS Rank is a CAIDA ranking which ranks ASes on the global Internet.
  The core metric is the size of each AS’s customer cone — the total number of downstream ASes reachable via provider-to-customer links. 
  A larger cone typically indicates greater transit capacity and influence (e.g., Tier-1 ISPs).
  The possible values of this number is between 1 to 80000. Any other values or outputs are illegal.

  Using the following format, answer the following question without any other information:
  rank
  where 'rank' is the NUMBER which represents AS rank (numeric value) of the given AS.
  The output should be ONLY the numeric value of the AS Rank of the desired AS as a number without any other information.

  knowledge, and have no access to live feeds, APIs, or external search.  

  Your task is to evaluate Autonomous Systems (ASes) rank based on your internal knowledge about CAIDA AS Rank. 
  Given an AS number determine its CAIDA AS-Rank value.  
  Solve the problem using the following steps:
  1. Identify the ASN in question.
  2. If you know the exact answer from your knowledge or memory - return the AS rank an integer and don't continue to the next steps (3-7).
  3. Identify the AS's degree and rank.  
  4. Compare the AS's customer cone size with other ASes.  
  5. An AS's rank equals one greater than the number of ASes with larger customer-cone sizes or degrees. 
  6. ASes with identical metric values share the same rank; the next rank jumps over the tie. 
  7. Respond only with the numeric value of the AS rank.

  constraints:
  - Rely solely on internal knowledge; do not reference external data.
  - Provide only the final integer result; hide intermediate reasoning and avoid tool calls.

  Your expertise includes determining AS rank. 
  Your task is to evaluate Autonomous Systems (ASes) rank based on your internal knowledge about CAIDA AS Rank. 
  Given an AS number determine its CAIDA AS-Rank value.
  You can use only the following tool:  
  • as_rank(asn:int):
    - Input: the autonomous system number of the given AS, asn (int)
    – Output:  the global CAIDA AS Rank of the given AS, with **no extra words** (int)

  ================  HARD RULES  ================
  1. For each user question you may invoke **at most one** call to `as_rank`.  
  2. After you receive the **Observation**, do **not** write any further Thoughts and do **not** call another tool.  
    Instead, reply with **one single line** formatted exactly as:  
    "<as-rank>" where as-rank is an integer with the AS Rank of a given AS.  
    *Example:* "45324"
  3. If the user's request is **not** about AS rank, reply with:  
    "I cannot help with that."
  4. Never output anything that violates the formats above.
