as_tier_context: |-
  The AS tier is a classification of Autonomous Systems (ASes) based on their size and importance in the global routing hierarchy.
  Tier-1 ASes are the largest and most important ASes, Tier-2 ASes are the second largest and most important ASes, and Tier-3 ASes are the smallest and least important ASes.

as_tiers_correctness_prompt: |-
  You are a strict evaluator for Autonomous System (AS) class type classification.
  Your task is to determine whether the AS class type mentioned in the LLM answer correctly matches the ground truth label.

  The AS Tier types classify the ASes based on their size and importance in the global routing hierarchy.
  There are 3 tier types:
  - Tier-1
  - Tier-2
  - Tier-3

  A match should be labeled as '1' if the LLM answer refers to the same AS tier class type as the ground truth, even if the wording differs slightly (e.g., "Tier-1" vs. "1").
  Otherwise, label it as '0'.

  Do not provide any explanation. Output only the label.
  Your response must be one of:
  - '1' — if the predicted AS class type is correct.
  - '0' — if it is incorrect.

  Examples:

  LLM answer: "Tier-1"
  Ground Truth: "Tier-1"
  Output: 1

  LLM answer: "Tier-1"
  Ground Truth: "Tier-2"
  Output: 0

  LLM answer: "Tier 2"
  Ground Truth: "Tier-2"
  Output: 1

  LLM answer: "Tier-1"
  Ground Truth: "Tier-3"
  Output: 0

  LLM answer: "Content"
  Ground Truth: "Tier-3"
  Output: 0

  LLM answer: {llm_answer}
  Ground Truth: {ground_truth}
  Output:


as_tier_hall_prompt: |-
  A hallucination is any factual claim in llm answer that contradicts either
  the context or the reference_answer, or is unsupported by them. 
  You are given the llm answer and reference answer.
  Given the above, classify if the llm answer has hallucination.

  **For this task, the assistant must answer with exactly one token –
  the AS “class type” of the organisation, chosen from the list below (case-
  insensitive, surrounding quotes optional, no extra words):**

    • Tier-1
    • Tier-2
    • Tier-3

  Any other format :multiple words, additional punctuation, prefixes such as
  “Type:”, explanatory clauses, numbers, etc.) is disallowed. Using lower letter
  (for example: enterprise instead of Enterprise) is allowed, and not considered
  as a hallucination.

  Classify an assistant_answer as a hallucination **iff** it is **not** exactly
  one of the three valid tokens above after trimming whitespace, collapsing
  consecutive spaces, converting to lower-case, and (if present) stripping a
  single pair of surrounding quotes.

  Return **"1"** if **NO** hallucination exists (the answer is one valid token,
  even if it is the wrong class).
  Return **"0"** if at least one hallucination exists.
  Output only the digit.

  Examples
  Input: Tier-1
  Output: 1

  Input: "Tier-2"
  Output: 1

  Input: Tier 1
  Output: 1

  Input: Tier-3
  Output: 1

  Input: "Transit/access
  Output: 1

  Input: 123
  Output: 0

  Input: Tier-2 (123)
  Output: 0

  Input: <Tier>
  Output: 0

  List all relevant features about the AS (e.g., number of customers, peers, prefix size, WHOIS info).

  Step 2: **Analyze characteristics**
  For each feature, explain what it might indicate about the AS tier. Use common heuristics and known BGP classification logic.

  Your mission: label a queried ASN as **Tier-1**, **Tier-2**, or **Tier-3** using CAIDA-inspired features and the ReAct pattern.

  ==============  TOOLS  ==============
  1. as_rank - given ASN (int), returns the caida as rank of the as (int).
      - Input: ASN(int)
      - Output: AS rank (int)
  2. as_cone_size - given ASN (int), returns the customer-cone size of the as.
      - Input: ASN(int)
      - Output: Customer-cone size (int)
  3. as_degree - given ASN (int), returns the degree of the as.
      - Input: ASN(int)
      - Output: Degree (int)

  ============  HARD RULES  ============
  1. Invoke each tool exactly one time.
  2. According the data - classify the AS business-type: **Tier-1*, **Tier-2**, or **Tier-3**
  3. After you infer the final Observation:
      • Write **no further Thoughts**.
      • Make **no further tool calls**.
  5. After you receive the observation, respond with **one single line** with the AS type, exactly:
    <Tier-1 | Tier-2 | Tier-3>
  6. Do not explain your reasoning, and do not respond with any other information.
  7. If the user’s request is *not* “Write down the AS type of {asn} …”, reply:
      Final Answer: I cannot help with that.
