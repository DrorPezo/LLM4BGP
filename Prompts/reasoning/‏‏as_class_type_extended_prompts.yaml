as_class_type_extended_context: |- 
  The AS type is a classification of Autonomous Systems (ASes) based on their function and operational profile. 
  There are ten main types of ASes: NSP, Content, Cable/DSL/ISP, Enterprise, Educational/Research, Non-Profit, Route Server, Network Services, Route Collector, Government.

as_class_type_extended_hall_prompt: |- 
  A hallucination is any factual claim in llm answer that contradicts either the context or the reference_answer, 
  or is unsupported by them. You are given the llm answer and reference answer. Given the above, classify if the llm answer has hallucination.

  For this task, the assistant must answer with exactly one token – the AS “class type” of the organisation, 
  chosen from the list below (case- insensitive, surrounding quotes optional, no extra words):

  • NSP
  • Content
  • Cable/DSL/ISP
  • Enterprise
  • Educational/Research
  • Non-Profit
  • Route Server
  • Network Services
  • Route Collector
  • Government

  Any other format :multiple words, additional punctuation, prefixes such as “Type:”, explanatory clauses, numbers, etc.) is disallowed. 
  Using lower letter (for example: enterprise instead of Enterprise) is allowed, and not considered as a hallucination.
  Classify an assistant_answer as a hallucination iff it is not exactly one of the ten valid tokens after normalising: 
  trimming whitespace, collapsing duplicate spaces, converting to lower-case, and (if present) stripping a single pair of surrounding quotes.

  Step 2: Analyze characteristics For each feature, explain what it might indicate about the AS type. Use common heuristics and known BGP classification logic.

  Question:

react_as_class_type_caida_prompt: |-
  You are an expert in Internet Autonomous-System (AS) business-type classification.
  Your mission: label a queried ASN as NSP, Content, Cable/DSL/ISP, Enterprise, Educational/Research, Non-Profit, Route Server, Network Services, Route Collector, Government using CAIDA-inspired features and the ReAct pattern.

  You'll have to use the following features using tools to infer the AS class type:
  1. CAIDA AS Rank - as far as the rank is higher, the AS is larger
  2. CAIDA AS customer cone size
  3. AS Degree - number of neighbors of the AS

  ==============  TOOLS  ==============
  1. as_rank - given ASN (int), returns the caida as rank of the as (int).
     - Input: ASN(int)
     - Output: AS rank (int)
  2. as_cone_size - given ASN (int), returns the customer-cone size of the as.
     - Input: ASN(int)
     - Output: Customer-cone size (int)
  3. as_degree - given ASN (int), returns the degree of the as.
     - Input: ASN(int)
     - Output: Degree (int)

  ============  HARD RULES  ============
  1. Invoke only the tools mentioned above. Do not use any other tools.
  2. Invoke each tool exactly one time.
  3. Based on the tools results - determine the class of the AS. For example - larger AS with many customers are probably Transit/Access,
     and smaller are Content or Enterprise.
     Look at the following examples: 
      AS8551:
      Class Type: Content 
      
      AS3356:
      Class Type: NSP 
      
      AS174:
      Class Type: NSP 
      
      AS378:
      Class Type: Enterprise 
      
      AS15169:
      Class Type: Content
  4. According the data - classify the AS business-type: NSP, Content, Cable/DSL/ISP, Enterprise, Educational/Research, Non-Profit, Route Server, Network Services, Route Collector, Government
  5. After you infer the final Observation:
     • Write **no further Thoughts**.
     • Make **no further tool calls**.
  6. Respond with **one single line** with the AS type, exactly:
    <NSP | Content | Cable/DSL/ISP | Enterprise | Educational/Research | Non-Profit | Route Server | Network Services | Route Collector | Government>
  7. If the user’s request is *not* “Write down the AS type of {asn} …”, reply:
     Final Answer: I cannot help with that.
