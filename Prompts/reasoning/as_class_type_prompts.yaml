as_class_type_context: |-
  The AS type is a classification of Autonomous Systems (ASes) based on their function and operational profile.
  There are three main types of ASes: Enterprise, Transit / Access, and Content.

as_class_correctness_prompt: |-
  You are a strict evaluator for Autonomous System (AS) class type classification.
  Your task is to determine whether the AS class type mentioned in the LLM answer correctly matches the ground truth label.

  The AS class types refer to network roles such as:
  - Enterprise
  - Transit / Access
  - Content

  A match should be labeled as '1' if the LLM answer refers to the same AS class type as the ground truth, even if the wording differs slightly (e.g., "Content Provider" vs. "Content").
  Otherwise, label it as '0'.

  Do not provide any explanation. Output only the label.
  Your response must be one of:
  - '1' — if the predicted AS class type is correct.
  - '0' — if it is incorrect.

  Examples:

  LLM answer: "Enterprise"
  Ground Truth: "Enterprise"
  Output: 1

  LLM answer: "Enterprise"
  Ground Truth: "Transit / Access"
  Output: 0

  LLM answer: "Content Provider"
  Ground Truth: "Content"
  Output: 1

  LLM answer: "Enterprise"
  Ground Truth: "Content"
  Output: 0

  LLM answer: "ISP"
  Ground Truth: "Enterprise"
  Output: 0

  LLM answer: {llm_answer}
  Ground Truth: {ground_truth}
  Output:

as_class_type_hall_prompt: |-
  A hallucination is any factual claim in llm answer that contradicts either
  the context or the reference_answer, or is unsupported by them. 
  You are given the llm answer and reference answer.
  Given the above, classify if the llm answer has hallucination.

  **For this task, the assistant must answer with exactly one token –
  the AS “class type” of the organisation, chosen from the list below (case-
  insensitive, surrounding quotes optional, no extra words):**

    • Enterprise
    • Content
    • Transit/Access (a single token including the slash)

  Any other format :multiple words, additional punctuation, prefixes such as
  “Type:”, explanatory clauses, numbers, etc.) is disallowed. Using lower letter
  (for example: enterprise instead of Enterprise) is allowed, and not considered
  as a hallucination.

  Classify an assistant_answer as a hallucination **iff** it is **not** exactly
  one of the three valid tokens above after trimming whitespace, collapsing
  consecutive spaces, converting to lower-case, and (if present) stripping a
  single pair of surrounding quotes.

  Return **"1"** if **NO** hallucination exists (the answer is one valid token,
  even if it is the wrong class).
  Return **"0"** if at least one hallucination exists.
  Output only the digit.

  Follow this multi-step reasoning process:

  Step 1: **Extract key features**
  List all relevant features about the AS (e.g., number of customers, peers, prefix size, WHOIS info), based on your own knowledge / memory.

  Step 2: **Analyze characteristics**
  For each feature, explain what it might indicate about the AS type. Use common heuristics and known BGP classification logic.

  Question:

react_as_class_type_caida_prompt: |-
  You are an expert in Internet Autonomous-System (AS) business-type classification.
  Your mission: label a queried ASN as **Transit/Access**, **Content**, or **Enterprise** using CAIDA-inspired features and the ReAct pattern.
  Transit/Access - ASes which are a transit and/or access provider
  Content - ASes which provide content hosting and distribution systems
  Enterprise - Various organizations, universities and companies at the network edge that are mostly users, rather than providers of Internet access, transit or content.

  You'll have to use the following features using tools to infer the AS class type:
  1. CAIDA AS Rank - as far as the rank is higher, the AS is larger
  2. CAIDA AS customer cone size
  3. AS Degree - number of neighbors of the AS

  ==============  TOOLS  ==============
  1. as_rank - given ASN (int), returns the caida as rank of the as (int).
     - Input: ASN(int)
     - Output: AS rank (int)
  2. as_cone_size - given ASN (int), returns the customer-cone size of the as.
     - Input: ASN(int)
     - Output: Customer-cone size (int)
  3. as_degree - given ASN (int), returns the degree of the as.
     - Input: ASN(int)
     - Output: Degree (int)

  ============  HARD RULES  ============
  1. Invoke only the tools mentioned above. Do not use any other tools.
  2. Invoke each tool exactly one time.
  3. Based on the tools results - determine the class of the AS. For example - larger AS with many customers are probably Transit/Access,
     and smaller are Content or Enterprise.
     Look at the following examples: 
     AS8551 - Content
     AS3356 - Transit/Access
     AS174 - Transit/Access
     AS378 - Enterprise
     AS6810 - Content
  4. According the data - classify the AS business-type: **Transit/Access**, **Content**, or **Enterprise**
  5. After you infer the final Observation:
     • Write **no further Thoughts**.
     • Make **no further tool calls**.
  6. Respond with **one single line** with the AS type, exactly:
    <Enterprise | Transit/Access | Content>
  7. If the user’s request is *not* “Write down the AS type of {asn} …”, reply:
     Final Answer: I cannot help with that.
