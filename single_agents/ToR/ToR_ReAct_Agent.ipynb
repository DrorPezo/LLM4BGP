Disregard boilerplate or stale text in WHOIS snippets.\n","\n","    B) PeeringDB posture (primary peer/transit discriminator; leverage all fields qualitatively)\n","      • Assign highest weight to TWO‑SIDED, SYMMETRIC declarations across the fields below. Symmetry should default to “peers” unless strong contradictory evidence exists.\n","      • `policy_general` + `policy_ratio` + `policy_contracts`: “Open/Selective” with “Ratio: No” and “Contracts: Not Required” on both sides supports peering. One‑sided “Restrictive/Contracts Required” weakly indicates transit only when combined with clear asymmetry in other signals.\n","      • `policy_locations` / IX/facility overlap: overlapping regions/cities/IXPs on BOTH sides supports feasible p2p; no overlap weakens peering only when WHOIS and routes provide strong p2c signals.\n","      • `ix_count` & `deployed_fac_count`: large numbers on both sides (with overlap) support p2p; extreme one‑sidedness suggests p2c only with corroboration from WHOIS or routes. Use `rs_peer_count` to confirm shared route‑server participation; RS‑only adjacencies are NOT transit evidence.\n","      • `speeds`, `traffic_levels`, `prefixes4`, `prefixes6` and `as_cone_size` from CAIDA indicate scale/capacity; use only as footprint context. **Never equate “bigger” with “provider‑likeness” by itself.**\n","      • `info_scope` (Global/International/Regional/National): symmetry supports p2p; “Regional/National” vs “Global” asymmetry leans p2c only with WHOIS or route corroboration.\n","      • `as_type` / `as_types`: content↔NSP or CDN↔NSP often peer even with scale differences; enterprise↔NSP less likely. Use only as a weak hint within the context of other signals.\n","      • `as_set` / `irr_as_set`: useful to align with IRR but not directional on its own.\n","      • `notes`, `aka`, `policy_url`, `looking_glass`, `status_dashboard`: operator‑declared policies can corroborate peering (e.g., “announce only own and customers (not peers/providers)”); if absent or marketing‑oriented, treat as weak.\n","\n","    C) ROUTES (valley‑free orientation; strict, non‑RS corroboration)\n","      • Clean paths by ignoring prepending and non‑ASNs; count direction only when ASNs are adjacent (“… A B …” ⇒ A→B).\n","      • Consider route orientation decisive only when ALL are true:\n","          – Appearances are exclusively one‑way across a substantial sample of non‑RS paths (ignore route‑server only samples); AND\n","          – This does not contradict peer‑symmetric PeeringDB and neutral WHOIS; AND\n","          – Multiple non‑RS BGP collectors/vantage points show the same one‑way orientation.\n","      • One‑way samples confined to route servers, mixed or thin samples, or balanced adjacencies must be treated as peer‑like and cannot justify p2c on their own.\n","\n","    D) CAIDA structure cues (tie‑breaker only; never primary)\n","      • Use CAIDA fields (`as_rank`, `as_cone_size`, `as_degree`, number of providers/peers/transit) only to break ties when WHOIS and PeeringDB provide no transit signals and routes are balanced or absent.\n","      • A clear provider‑likeness gap (e.g., one AS has no upstreams, significantly higher degree/cone size) can support p2c only when combined with WHOIS AS‑specific ANY/DEFAULT or a restrictive PeeringDB posture.
